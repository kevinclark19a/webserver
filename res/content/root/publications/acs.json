	"description": "Heteroleptic platinum complexes with one C^N cyclometalating ligand and one redox-active formazanate ligand are described. A general synthetic strategy gives rise to 14 new complexes, all characterized by cyclic voltammetry and UVâˆ’vis absorption spectroscopy. The new complexes feature multielectron redox chemistry and strong absorption over most of the visible range, with many of these features strongly influenced by the substitution pattern of the formazanate."
